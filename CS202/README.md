# COSC202 - Data Structures and Algorithms I

### Unix, I/O, Object-oriented programming, hash tables, STL (deques, sets, maps), stacks, queues, linked lists, algorithm analysis, trees (AVL and binary search), heaps

### Contains C++ code

- Lab 1 - Checkerboard & Moonglow: Two programs - checkerboard generates a board of characters using parameters; moonglow processes a file and gets rid of garbage data
- Lab 2 - PGM: Five files that mess with the .pgm format - pgminfo gets info on pgm, bigwhite generates a pgm of white pixels, neg creates a negative image, hflip and vflip flip pgm horizontally and vertically respectively
- Lab 3 - PGM 2, Electric Boogaloo: One file that can read and write a pgm, as well as crop, rotate, pad (add a border) and panel (duplicate)
- Lab 4 - Hash Tables: Generates, stores and manages a hash table
- Lab 5 - Bitmatrix: Creates bitmatrices, as well as perform arithmetic on them and output a displayable version 
- Lab 6 - Keno: Fraction manages a fraction and performs arithmetic, while Keno calculates odds using Fraction
- Lab 7 - Code Processor: Simulates a server that holds data like names and phone numbers
- Lab 8 - Linked Lists: Manages and manipulates a linked data structure
- Lab 9 - Recursion: Enum enumerates 1s and 0s, while ss_solver uses enum to automatically solve a Neopets game called ShapeShifter
- Lab A - Binary Search Tree: Creates and manages a binary search tree
- Lab B - AVL Tree: Creates and manages an AVL tree
