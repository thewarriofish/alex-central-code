- Lab 1 - Music File Information: Formats and sorts a list of song names by artists and albums
- Lab 2 - Hashylvania: Organizes a list of names (through standard input) by hash, creating a hash table in the process
- Lab 3 - MIDI: Converts a MIDI from note file format to event file format and vice-versa
- Lab 4 - Enumeration: Enumerates all matrices with given parameters
- Lab 5 - Superball: Plays a game of Superball, a matching game of sorts
- Lab 6 - Sorting: Implements merge sort and quick sort
- Lab 7 - Maze Solver: Uses depth-first search to find the shortest path out of a maze
- Lab 8 - City Streets: Uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path through a city given certain information
- Lab 9 - Word Dice: Uses network flow to find all the possible answers of a given roll of some word dice
